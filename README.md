# three-tier-uso
Three-tier application to add users using Faker.js data both locally and on vm DigitalOcean (update July 2023: paused on DigitalOcean for testing updates and new formatting)

# how to use
To install this project, follow these steps:

Download or clone the project
Add it to your code editor tool
npm or yarn install dependencies
node http_server.js

NOTE: I currently have it configured through DigitalOcean, a cloud platform that runs on an IP address that is not local to your server. To run this application locally, edit the POST url to be http://localhost:3000 or the port of your choosing. 

# what it does
Add lots of fake users with fake data, see them pop up!

# future possibilities
*styling* to come
